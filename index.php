Smith machine bench press:

    The bench press or dumbbell bench-press is performed while lying face up on a bench, by pushing a weight away from the chest.</br> This is a compound exercise that also involves the triceps and the front deltoids, also recruits the upper and lower back muscles, and traps.</br> The bench press is the king of all upper body exercises and is one of the most popular chest exercises in the world.</br> It is the final exercise in 'The big 3'.</br>
        Equipment: dumbbells, barbell, Smith machine or bench press machine.</br>
        Major variants: incline ~ (more emphasis on the upper pectorals), decline ~ (more emphasis on the lower pectorals), narrow grip ~ (more emphasis on the triceps), push-up (face down using the body weight), neck press (with the bar over the neck, to isolate the pectorals), vertical dips (using parallel dip bars) or horizontal dips (using two benches with arms on the near bench and feet on the far bench, and dropping the buttocks to the floor and pushing back up.)
