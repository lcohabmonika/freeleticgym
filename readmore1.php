<b><h2>1.Start walking, jogging or cycling:</h2></b>
<h3> No matter what your speed is, walking, jogging and cycling are very important parts of a healthy lifestyle as they are activities that keep your muscles active and your blood flowing. If you need to keep your knees strong or have body aches and pains then cycling is the best solution.

   <li> Come up with a daily walking, jogging or cycling routine that fits with your schedule (i.e. go for a jog everyday at 6:00 p.m.). After a while you can increase your distance, speed and eventually time.</li></br>
    <li>Go out of your way to walk more. For example, if you go to the grocery store try to park in the farthest spot from the entrance so you are forced to walk those extra steps to get there.</li></br>
    <li>Walk or bike to work/school. If you live close enough to work or school a good solution would be to start walking or cycling</li>.</br>
    <li>If you jog you should jog at least a kilometer to keep the fat off, but it is very important to pace yourself.</li></br>

<b><h2>2. Exercise at home:</h2></b> 
<h3>Not everyone has the time or money to go to the gym and there is no need to. Working out at home is very easy and can be very beneficial. Some at-home exercises include:

   <li> Push-ups. Use your weight against the floor or wall to work on your upper body strength.</li>
    <li>Sit-ups. Sit-ups can be done by simply laying on the ground or, with a more advanced technique, with a chair or exercise ball.</li>
    <li> Yoga practices such as downward facing dog or sun salutations are easily done on the carpeted ground or on a yoga mat.</li>

<b><h2>3. Exercise in the gym.</b></h2>
 <h3>If you like the gym atmosphere and can afford the membership then the gym is a great place to stay fit.

   <li> Utilize the machines for cardio and weights, but be careful and never use a weight that is too heavy.</li>
	 <li>Use smaller weights and you will find that you will progress through the weights very rapidly.</li>
    <li>Learn strength training and muscle toning techniques from an instructor or professional.</li>
